The extra Python exercises I do (outside "Learn Python the Hard Way")

2017-01-18, Wednesday

Some exercises from this site:
http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html

Including… 
max_fun.py = “define a function max() which takes two numbers and returns the larger of the two”
max_of_three.py = “define a function max_of_three() which takes three numbers and returns the largest of the three”
find_len.py = "Define a function that computes the length of a given list or string. (It is true that Python has the len() function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)"
